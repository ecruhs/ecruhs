Hi! I'm Emily Cornelius Ruhs and I am a postdoctoral position with Cara Brook at the University of Chicago. 
I will be working on laboratory and computational analysis of viral tolerance as well as field aspects of health and viral shedding in bats in Madagascar.

Broadly, I am interested in ecoimmunology, ecophysiology, biological trade-offs, and disease and transmission dynamics. 
 
 
 
*Background*

Prior to my upcoming position, I was a postdoc at the University of South Florida investigating the impacts of body mass on immune function and gene expression in birds and mammals. Previously, I was a postdoctoral contractor for USGS National Wildlife Center understanding the broad impacts of climate change on Wildlife Health. In 2018, I had a postdoctoral fellowship with Drs. François Vézina and Oliver Love conducting field and lab-based research on various passerine species examining phenotypic mismatch, physiological responses in response to the acute environmental challenges and understanding the carryover effects of high-performing individuals during the winter and summer portions of the annual cycle.

I received my PhD in Wildlife Ecology in 2017 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in Dr. William Karasov's laboratory. My research examined the immune function and physiology of wild birds and its response to variation in resource availability. I worked with black-capped chickadees and boreal chickadees in the boreal forest near Québec city, Canada. 

I received my Masters of Science degree in Ecology at the University of Georgia in 2013 under the advisement of Drs. Sonia Altizer and Andrew Davis. For my Master's project, I examined the degree to which neotropical songbirds face resource trade-off between condition and immune defense during migration. Specifically, I investigated how lipid storage, stress, parasites and immune defenses interact during the migrations of several songbird species that pass through coastal Georgia each fall. 

I completed my Bachelor's of Science in Zoology at Michigan State University in 2011. After working in the Avian Health and Disease Ecology lab under the advisement of Dr. Jennifer Owen, I realized how much I enjoy working with birds, and learning about immune function, disease dynamics and phenotypic flexibility.
